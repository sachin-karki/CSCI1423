a.Describe the difference between compiled and interpreted languages giving examples for each

Ans: A compiled language is a programming language that translates the entire code at one time,
and saves an executible file thus saving time for faster execution is called a compiled language.
C, C++, COBOL are compiled language.

Interpreted language however is a programming language that translates each code line by line,
then converts them into machine readable form thus taking more time for execution.
Perl,Python, JavaScript is an example of interpreted language.

b. Describe the difference between strongly and loosely typed languages giving examples of each.

Ans: The language which requires the declaration of a variable at the beginning is called strongly typed 
language. JAVA is an example

The language that does not require the declartaion of a varibale at the beginning is called loosely typed language.
Perl is an example.

c. Explain what three things are needed to control a loop in programming.
Ans: Set, Check, Change are the things needed to control a loop in programming.

The Function of a set is to define and establish the value of an iterator.
The Fucntion of check inspect or examine those value, make sure it works 
according to required condition.
The Function of change is to alter those values.

d. Explain what an array is and how to access individual items in the array.
Ans: Array is a group of strings or variables combined together to easily access 
and execute those varibles when needed. 
for example: @foo = (1,3,9,"apple",5,"cat"); is a an array.
To access individual items in an array, one can use '[ ]' these brackets and 
their consecutive number inside those brackets to access them.
for an instance, if i need to access 3rd item from the above array which is
technically "9", i would have to do something like this:
print "show me @foo[2] \n";
I used the number 2 because inside an array the position of an item starts from 0.
