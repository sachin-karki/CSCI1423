This folder contains useful files to drop into the boot partition of a microSD card 
that has been flashed with Raspbian.  The intent is that these files are placed into 
the partition after the img file has been flashed but before the first boot of the Pi.

ssh:  This is a zero byte file that will enable the ssh server on first boot for 
remote logins.

wpa_supplicant.conf:  This file needs to be modified with the appropriate router 
information and will enable a wireless connection to the specified wireless network on 
first boot.
